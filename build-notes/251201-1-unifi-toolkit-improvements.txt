UniFi Toolkit GUI improvements

- Need to add some sort of 'Back to dashboard' button on each tool (ie. Wi-Fi Stalker)

- Crosstalk branding on the dashboard - logo / colors - logo files have been uploaded to /logo, colors are:

Blue:  #2B3990
Orange:  #F15A29
Grey:  #939598

- let's add a dark mode / light mode toggle for the entire application.  The toggle should be in the upper right-hand corner of the dashboard header for the UniFi Toolkit, and the selected option should carry through to sub-applications.
